[ElevenLabs UI](https://ui.elevenlabs.io) is a new open source library of customizable React components for building interfaces with the ElevenLabs Agents & Audio SDKs.

Built on `shadcn/ui`, it provides full control over UI primitives like message threads, input boxes, reasoning panels, and response actions.

# Getting started

To install the components, you can initialize with [our CLI](https://ui.elevenlabs.io/docs/setup), and pick your components, import them, and start building.

```bash
npx agents-cli@latest ui
```

[Read the docs](https://ui.elevenlabs.io/docs) and start building better voice & agent interfaces, faster.
