# AI Caption Editor with React Native

## Overview

A comprehensive React Native mobile application that combines AI-powered caption generation with advanced text-to-speech capabilities using ElevenLabs. This tutorial project demonstrates how to build a modern, feature-rich mobile app with real-time data synchronization, authentication, and professional-grade error tracking.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Caption Generation** - Intelligent video caption creation and editing
- **ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech Integration** - High-quality voice synthesis for captions
- **Real-time Data Synchronization** - Instant updates across devices with Convex
- **Passwordless Authentication** - Seamless user experience with Clerk
- **Professional Error Tracking** - Comprehensive monitoring with Sentry
- **Haptic Feedback** - Enhanced mobile user experience
- **Video & Audio Playback** - Built-in media handling capabilities
- **Secure Storage** - Protected user data and preferences

## How It Works

The app leverages modern React Native architecture with Expo for cross-platform development. At its core, ElevenLabs powers the caption generation workflow - converting text into high-quality speech audio and providing precise timestamps for each text block. This timing data enables accurate caption synchronization with video playback, creating seamless audio-visual alignment.

The ElevenLabs integration handles both text-to-speech synthesis and timestamp extraction, allowing users to generate professional-quality voiceovers with frame-accurate caption timing. Convex manages real-time data synchronization across devices, while Jotai handles efficient state management and NativeWind provides utility-first styling. The app includes native features like haptic feedback and secure storage for an enhanced mobile experience.

## Technologies Used

- **ElevenLabs API** - Text-to-speech synthesis for caption audio
- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development framework
- **Expo** - Development platform and toolchain
- **Convex** - Real-time database and file storage backend
- **Clerk** - User authentication and management
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Jotai** - Modern state management library
- **NativeWind** - Utility-first styling system
